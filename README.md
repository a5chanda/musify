#Musify

Product Description: 

Musify is a smart transcription service for music lovers both amateur and experienced. Users can upload files of their favorite songs, and our application transcribes the audio into sheet music from the comfort of their own browser. As music lovers ourselves, as well as aspiring software developers & data scientists, we wanted to learn more about data science in a fun way that would be useful to ourselves and others. By using a combination of complex Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) algorithms to estimate the pitch of the sounds, as well as use our own data estimation algorithms to retrieve the notes from said pitches, we learned a lot about audio analysis and data science.
